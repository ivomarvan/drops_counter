# Drop counter hardware and software for the blind and visually impaired

The drops pass through an optical gate, are counted, and then announced to the user via voice. 
Sounds corresponding to the numbers, pre-stored on an SD card, are used. 
Multiple languages are supported through the gTTS library.
